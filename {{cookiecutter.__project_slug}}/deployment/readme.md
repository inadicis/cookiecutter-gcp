# deployment folder

Here you will find all files required for deployment purposes, remotely and locally. This includes environment variables
management (with [dotenv](.env)), docker management ([Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and potential docker-compose files), as
well as CI/CD with remote platforms (in our case, GCP with [cloudbuild yaml files](cloudbuild-dev.yaml)).
